(Epic)
As a user I want to find a fun actionable item
so I can avoid a boring/nonmotivating new year's resolution

  As a guest user

    I want to complete a quiz evaluation
    so I can view my results

    I want the option to create an account
    so I can save my results OR try again

    I want to be able to view all 're(al)solutions'
    so that I can find an actionable item
    without completing an evaluation


  As a signed-in user

    I want the option to complete another evaluation
    so I can see additional results

    I want to view my previous results:

        I want to view my 'type'
        so I can read the description assigned to me

        I want to view my 're(al)solutions'
        so I can access the actionables again

    I want to update my profile
    so my information is current and secure
